            <h2>Introduction to Topic 3: Basics of Development Practices for Website Cybersecurity </h2>
            <p> 

        
                
                There are several ways to ensure that a website is properly equipped to handle cyber threats and vulnerabilities. 
                An effective strategy would be the practice of conducting input validation and sanitization protocols through the process of ensuring 
                that all authorized users are validated on both client and server sides to prevent the likelihood of ransomware data from being processed. 
                There must also be protocols that cover the process of authenication and authorization through standards that are congruent 
                to strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and using encrypted cookies. This will greatly enahance the secruity 
                of an website in order to safegard senstive data. All of these methods are necessary for securing a website in an era where internet is vital
                for business transactions which opens up the door for cyber criminals to target websites for finanical gain. The importance of securing
                website applications are critical to maintain user trust, and ensure operational continuity. There a growing number of cyber threats developing
                on a daily basis and the contents of this website will equip users with the practices that are essential for an websites foundation and 
                will provide specific applications that monitor, detect, and mitigate risks. Let us dive into this complex subject!

            <h3> Cyber Threats to be aware of and hardening recommendations to secure your website: </h3>
            <ul>
                        <!-- Network Firewall section-->

                <li> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention: </li>
                <P>  
                    When it comes to developing websites there are attacks that can occur known as XSS which is a malicious script that is injected
                    into a website, it gives attackers privlege to steal user data or hijack sessions. Website developers have the obligation to prevent 
                    XSS attacks by sanitizing user inputs, using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and escaping output data. There are certain tools
                    that can ehance the cyber protection of websites such as OWASP's XSS Filter which is a Open Web Application Secuirty Project. 
                    This tool is very useful approach to provide security and as a non-profit organization OWASP's gives customers the resources and guidance
                    to safeguard against XSS attacks

                <li> SQL Injection Prevention: </li>
                
                <P>  When it comes to the severity of attachs that a website can experience, an SQL injection is one of the most severe web application vulnerability
                where attackers manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious input. The consequences of this attack can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
                and full control of an website. This vulnerability shows the importance of conducting prevention methods through the use of parameterized queries. 
                The practice of parametrized queries esnsure that users are able to input that serves as data as opposed to executable SQL code. Another tactic to take
                when it comes to securing an website would be the implementation of an effective web application firewall. The Web Application Firewall is a 
                substantial tool that detects and blocks SQL injection attempts. Some of the most well known WAF comes from ModSecurity, Cloudflare WAF, and AWS WAF.
                </P>
                
                <li> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): </li>
                <p>    


                  This vulnerablity is a common web security vulnerability that gives an attacker the potential of deceiving a user into performing unintended
                actions on a trusted website without their authentic consent. These attacks can lead to major consequences that impact business transactions, 
                    data modification, and account changes. There are certain prevention methods to take when attempting to prevent CSRF attacks on your website.
                    The ability of using anti-CSRF tokens will greatly enhance the security of a website through giving attackers a random token that is unique per session,
                    and expires after each use. The CSRF vulnerability is a very serious weakness in many websites, so it is imperative to make sure you have the proper 
                    defense mechanisms that can prevent the attack from occuring.
