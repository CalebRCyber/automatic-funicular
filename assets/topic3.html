            <h2>Introduction to Topic 3: Basics of Development Practices for Website Cybersecurity </h2>
            <p> 

        
                
                There are several ways to ensure that a website is properly equipped to handle cyber threats and vulnerabilities. 
                An effective strategy would be the practice of conducting input validation and sanitization protocols through the process of ensuring 
                that all authorized users are validated on both client and server sides to prevent the likelihood of ransomware data from being processed. 
                There must also be protocols that cover the process of authenication and authorization through standards that are congruent 
                to strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and using encrypted cookies. This will greatly enahance the secruity 
                of an website in order to safegard senstive data. All of these methods are necessary for securing a website in an era where internet is vital
                for business transactions which opens up the door for cyber criminals to target websites for finanical gain. The importance of securing
                website applications are critical to maintain user trust, and ensure operational continuity. There a growing number of cyber threats developing
                on a daily basis and the contents of this website will equip users with the practices that are essential for an websites foundation and 
                will provide specific applications that monitor, detect, and mitigate risks. Let us dive into this complex subject!

            <h3> Cyber Threats to be aware of and hardening recommendations to secure your website: </h3>
            <ul>
                        <!-- Network Firewall section-->

                <li> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention: </li>
                <P>  
                    When it comes to developing websites there are attacks that can occur known as XSS which is a malicious script that is injected
                    into a website, it gives attackers privlege to steal user data or hijack sessions. Website developers have the obligation to prevent 
                    XSS attacks by sanitizing user inputs, using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and escaping output data. There are certain tools
                    that can ehance the cyber protection of websites such as OWASP's XSS Filter which is a Open Web Application Secuirty Project. 
                    This tool is very useful approach to provide security and as a non-profit organization OWASP's gives customers the resources and guidance
                    to safeguard against XSS attacks

                <li> SQL Injection Prevention: </li>
                
                <P>  When it comes to the severity of attachs that a website can experience, an SQL injection is one of the most severe web application vulnerability
                where attackers manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious input. The consequences of this attack can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
                and full control of an website. This vulnerability shows the importance of conducting prevention methods through the use of parameterized queries. 
                The practice of parametrized queries esnsure that users are able to input that serves as data as opposed to executable SQL code. Another tactic to take
                when it comes to securing an website would be the implementation of an effective web application firewall. The Web Application Firewall is a 
                substantial tool that detects and blocks SQL injection attempts. Some of the most well known WAF comes from ModSecurity, Cloudflare WAF, and AWS WAF.
                </P>
                
                <li> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): </li>
                <p>    


                  This vulnerablity is a common web security vulnerability that gives an attacker the potential of deceiving a user into performing unintended
                actions on a trusted website without their authentic consent. These attacks can lead to major consequences that impact business transactions, 
                    data modification, and account changes. There are certain prevention methods to take when attempting to prevent CSRF attacks on your website.
                    The ability of using anti-CSRF tokens will greatly enhance the security of a website through giving attackers a random token that is unique per session,
                    and expires after each use. The CSRF vulnerability is a very serious weakness in many websites, so it is imperative to make sure you have the proper 
                    defense mechanisms that can prevent the attack from occuring.

            <h3> Trends and Protocols in the field of Web Application Security : </h3>
            
            <p> 
                
            The every evolving landscape of Web Application Security is constantly growing and we will carefully examine some of the major industry 
            directions that are found today. There are central principles that can be found in the field of Web Application Security that includes
            the implementation of organizations and content creators adopting a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), AI and Machine Learning in Secuirty, 
            and developing Quantum-Safe Cryptography. Each of these major developments contribute in the overall increase of website applications 
            due to the complex nature of maintaining a website and ensuring its security. The development of serverless security is also another major development
            that we will discuss and focus on the nature of cloud-native and microservices-based applications.

                <li>AI-Powered Website Attacks: The Next Cybersecurity Challenge</li>
                
                <p>    
                    With the emergence of AI known as Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning, there are numerous challenges that are presented to web site
                    developers who seek to advance their defense mechanisms. The technology of AI has procuded many benefits for society but cyber criminals
                    have the audacity to manipulate AI in order to orchestrate sophisticated attacks. Understanding the roles of AI is imperative for web site
                    developers to understand in order to implement robust security measures. There are substanial methods to protect your website against AI-powered 
                    attacks that are consistent with conducting regulat software updates, strong access controls, and secure comunication protocols. The use of
                    communication protocols such as HTTPS with SSL/TLS certifcates are an effective strategy in risk mitigation of AI powered attacks. Web site developers
                    must be in constant guard against cyber threats through the use of these essential services that are designed to promote security.
                 </p>
                
                <li>The Roles of Serverless Security</li>
                
                <p>   
                    Serverless computing, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions, allows developers to run applications without managing infrastructure. 
                    However, this introduces new security challenges. Serverless security plays several crucial roles in mitigating risks while ensuring compliance and protection against cyber threats.
                    The essential benefits of serverless security networks has to do with protecting applications through an secure code execution environment. 
                    An environment that allows users and website developers to code sighn with integrity in tradition with the CIA triad. Through effective measures
                    of maintaining Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability web developers can utilize cloud networks to ensure protection for their websites.
