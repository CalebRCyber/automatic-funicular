                There are several ways to ensure that a website is properly equipped to handle cyber threats and vulnerabilities. 
                An effective strategy would be the practice of conducting input validation and sanitization protocols through the process of ensuring 
                that all authorized users are validated on both client and server sides to prevent the likelihood of ransomware data from being processed. 
                There must also be protocols that cover the process of authenication and authorization through standards that are congruent 
                to strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and using encrypted cookies. This will greatly enahance the secruity 
                of an website in order to safegard senstive data. All of these methods are necessary for securing a website in an era where internet is vital
                for business transactions which opens up the door for cyber criminals to target websites for finanical gain. The importance of securing
                website applications are critical to maintain user trust, and ensure operational continuity. There a growing number of cyber threats developing
                on a daily basis and the contents of this website will equip users with the practices that are essential for an websites foundation and 
                will provide specific applications that monitor, detect, and mitigate risks. Let us dive into this complex subject!

            <h3> Cyber Threats to be aware of how to properly protect your Website: </h3>
            <ul>
                        <!-- Network Firewall section-->

                <li> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention </li>
                <P>  
                    When it comes to developing websites there are attacks that can occur known as XSS which is a malicious script that is injected
                    into a website, it gives attackers privlege to steal user data or hijack sessions. Website developers have the obligation to prevent 
                    XSS attacks by sanitizing user inputs, using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and escaping output data. There are certain tools
                    that can ehance the cyber protection of websites such as OWASP's XSS Filter which is a Open Web Application Secuirty Project. 
                    This tool is very useful approach to provide security and as a non-profit organization OWASP's gives customers the resources and guidance
                    to safeguard against XSS attacks
                </P>

                <li> SQL Injection Prevention :</li>
                
                <P>  When it comes to the severity of attachs that a website can experience, an SQL injection is one of the most severe web application vulnerability
                where attackers manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious input. The consequences of this attack can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
                and full control of an website. This vulnerability shows the importance of conducting prevention methods through the use of parameterized queries. 
                The practice of parametrized queries esnsure that users are able to input that serves as data as opposed to executable SQL code. Another tactic to take
                when it comes to securing an website would be the implementation of an effective web application firewall. The Web Application Firewall is a 
                substantial tool that detects and blocks SQL injection attempts. Some of the most well known WAF comes from ModSecurity, Cloudflare WAF, and AWS WAF.

                <li> Common Threats of Web Application development:   </li>
                <p>    There are numerous cyber threats to be aware in the process and implementation of web 
                applications. One of the most common threats relates to the input validation and sanitization that 
                refers to the user input category such as form fields, URL parameters, and API requests. The threat of SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting,
                and command injection attacks is a direct result of poor input validation and sanitization.

            <h3>Popular Firewall Softwares for Web Application: </h3>
            <p> The purpose of web application firewalls is to protect against unathorized access attacks 
            and there are certain softwares to be aware which includes the web applicaiton firewalls, cloud based firewalls, 
            and network based firewalls. Each component will be broken down in their simplest forms below.</p>
            <ul>
                        <!-- My main content on cloud based WAF CJR-->

                <li>Cloud-Based WAFs</li>
                <p>    Vendors such as AWS WAF is an essential application tool that protects web apps hosted on AWS
                which integrates with CloudFront and API Gateway protocols. The tool of Cloudflare WAF is another reliable
                    software that provides DDoS protection, bot mitigation, and OWASP rules. These softwares are strong examples
                    of cloud based firewalls that provide an effective risk mitigation strucure for web applications. 
                 </p>
                <li>Software-Based (Host-Based) WAFs (Self-Hosted, Customizable)</li>
                <p>   Sofwares such as ModSecurity, NAXSI, and Imperva WAF are reliable softwares that fosues on host based website applications.
                   These softwars allow custom security configurtations but require manual updaates and maintance which is best
                    suied for hybrid cloud and on-premises deployments.
                </p>
                <li>Network Firewalls (Protecting Networks & Servers)</li>
                <p>   This is a traditional packet filtering firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic through 
                web applications that are defined with next gneration firewalls that add intrusion detection, deep packet inspection,
                and AI based security.</p>
