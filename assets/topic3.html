            <h2>Introduction to Topic 3: Basics of Development Practices for Website Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>
                There are several ways to ensure that a website is properly equipped to handle cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
                An effective strategy would be the practice of conducting input validation and sanitization protocols through the process of ensuring 
                that all authorized users are validated on both client and server sides to prevent the likelihood of ransomware data from being processed. 
                There must also be protocols that cover the process of authentication and authorization through standards that are congruent 
                to strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and using encrypted cookies. This will greatly enhance the security 
                of a website in order to safeguard sensitive data. All of these methods are necessary for securing a website in an era where the internet is vital
                for business transactions, which opens up the door for cybercriminals to target websites for financial gain. The importance of securing
                website applications is critical to maintain user trust and ensure operational continuity. There is a growing number of cyber threats developing
                on a daily basis, and the contents of this website will equip users with the practices that are essential for a website's foundation and 
                will provide specific applications that monitor, detect, and mitigate risks. Let us dive into this complex subject! 
            </p>

            <h3>Cyber Threats to be aware of and hardening recommendations to secure your website:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:</li>
                <p>  
                    When it comes to developing websites, there are attacks that can occur known as XSS, which is a malicious script injected
                    into a website, giving attackers privilege to steal user data or hijack sessions. Website developers have the obligation to prevent 
                    XSS attacks by sanitizing user inputs, using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and escaping output data. OWASP's XSS Filter, a tool
                    from the Open Web Application Security Project, is a very useful approach for providing security and safeguarding against XSS attacks.
                </p>

                <li>SQL Injection Prevention:</li>
                <p>  
                    SQL injection is one of the most severe web application vulnerabilities, where attackers manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious input.
                    The consequences of this attack can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and full control of a website. To prevent SQL injections, 
                    developers should use parameterized queries. Implementing a web application firewall (WAF) is also crucial in detecting and blocking SQL injection attempts. 
                    Some of the well-known WAFs include ModSecurity, Cloudflare WAF, and AWS WAF.
                </p>

                <li>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):</li>
                <p>
                    This vulnerability deceives users into performing unintended actions on a trusted website without their consent. CSRF attacks can 
                    have significant consequences on business transactions, data modification, and account changes. To prevent CSRF attacks, 
                    website developers can use anti-CSRF tokens, which are unique per session and expire after each use, providing better security against CSRF.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h3>Trends and Protocols in the Field of Web Application Security:</h3>
            <p>
                The ever-evolving landscape of Web Application Security is constantly growing. We will carefully examine some of the major industry 
                directions found today, including the adoption of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), AI and Machine Learning in Security, and Quantum-Safe Cryptography.
                These developments contribute to the overall improvement of website applications and the complex nature of maintaining a website's security.
                The rise of serverless security is also noteworthy, particularly with cloud-native and microservices-based applications.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>AI-Powered Website Attacks: The Next Cybersecurity Challenge</li>
                <p>  
                    With the emergence of AI and Machine Learning, web developers face numerous challenges in advancing defense mechanisms. Cybercriminals
                    are manipulating AI to orchestrate sophisticated attacks. Website developers must implement robust security measures, such as regular software 
                    updates, strong access controls, and secure communication protocols like HTTPS with SSL/TLS certificates, to mitigate risks from AI-powered attacks.
                </p>

                <li>The Roles of Serverless Security</li>
                <p>  
                    Serverless computing platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions allow developers to run applications without managing infrastructure. 
                    This introduces new security challenges, and serverless security plays a crucial role in mitigating risks while ensuring compliance and protection against cyber threats. 
                    It helps secure code execution environments, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability in cloud-based applications.
                </p>

                <li>The Role of Zero Trust in Website Security</li>
                <p>
                    Zero Trust emphasizes the "never trust, always verify" philosophy, where multi-factor authentication, least privilege access, micro-segmentation, 
                    and real-time threat monitoring are enforced. This strict protocol reduces unauthorized access and lateral movement by threat actors, strengthening website security.
