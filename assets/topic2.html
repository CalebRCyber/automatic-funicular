            <h2>Introduction to Topic 2: Firewalls in Web Application Security</h2>
            <p> 
                The implementation of firewalls is a proven cyber security measure that must be taken for any organization 
                to practice within the confides of the CIA triad which applies to web development. This is a critical component
                of web appplicaiton securty due to the purpose of providing a barrier between trusted
                internal networks and untrusted external traffic that comes through the internet. The benefits of firewalls
                surpass the protocols of blocking malicious traffic that prevents security threats from incidents such as data breaches.
                This protocol reduces the possibility of SQL injection, cross-site scripting, denial of service attacks, and 
                unauthorized access attempts. 
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features of Web Development firewalls: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Network Firewalls</li>
                <P>  This crucial protcol serves as a security system that monitors incoming and outgoing network
                traffic that is based on established security protocols. When it comes to the nature of web development
                this stage of security is often the first line of defense that prevents unathorized access. The main categories of 
                network firewalls is the protocols of packet filtering, stateful inspection, access control lists, and intrusion detection.
                </P>
                
                <li>Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) in Web Development:</li>
                
                <P>  This security tool is essential for the protection of web applications and APIs from critical threats that 
                come through online vulnerabilites. The WAF operates as the application layer of the OSI model that examines
                HTTP and HTTPS traffic by detecting suspicious activity. The main operation of WAF is to promote traffic inspection and threat
                detection that every web site application should implement.</P>
                
                <li> Common Threats of Web Application development:   </li>
                <p>    There are numerous cyber threats to be aware in the process and implementation of web 
                applications. One of the most common threats relates to the input validation and sanitization that 
                refers to the user input category such as form fields, URL parameters, and API requests. The threat of SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting,
                and command injection attacks is a direct result of poor input validation and sanitization. 
                    </p>
            </ul>

            <h3>Popular Web Development Frameworks</h3>
            <p>Several frameworks are widely used in web development to streamline the process. These frameworks help developers create dynamic and responsive websites, and often provide extensive documentation and community support. Some of the most popular include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React.js (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)</li>
                <li>Angular (Full framework for building dynamic web apps)</li>
                <li>Bootstrap (CSS framework for responsive design)</li>
            </ul>
