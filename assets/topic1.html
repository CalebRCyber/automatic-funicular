            <h2>Introduction to Web Application Security</h2>
            <p>     The basic overview of web application security is to give web applications cyber features that will enhance their 
                protection. There are many web vulnerabilites that cyber professional deal with on a daily basis which includes
                SQL injection attacks, intrusive authentication, and major data breaches. These different consequences of poor web
                application management shows the importance of implementating core secuirty principles of the CIA triad. The
                CIA triad is a principles that transfers to all aspects of cyber security including web development for the purpose
                of promoting Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
            
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features of Web Application Security </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>(Responsive Approach to a lack of Authentication and Access Controls:)</li>
                <p>     The issue of Access controls is very important for the purpose of ensureing that only authorized users can access certain
                    web applications. The protocols of user authentication involves the use of implementating strong password measures with 
                    multi-factor authentication applications to further enhance secuirty. The process of authentication comes through management 
                    methods such as RBAC which refers to role-based access control that allows users to assign roles with certain privileges
                    towards those who are certififed. This is an important issue and it must not be overlooked or neglected. 
                </p>
                <li>(Interaction through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces:)</li>
                <p>     The implemtation of Application Programming interfaces is what gives websites the amazing ability to communicate
                    and exchange data in an effective manner. The practice of API formation is essential to connnect front end web sites
                    with bach end servers, the integration of third-party services, and the enabling of mobile applications through web sites.
                    Since API contains senstive information such as data and information transmission it becomes imperative to secure them to 
                    prevent unathorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats. API's generate protocols between clients and servers which 
                    covers the major categories of authentication and authorization, data integrity and confidentiality, and standardized communications 
                    that are imperative for fully operability. 
                        
                    
                </p>
                <li>Efficient code management and optimization</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applications of Web Development</h3>
            <p>Web development is used in a variety of fields, from creating personal blogs to developing large-scale applications like e-commerce platforms, social networks, and more. Web developers work with clients to create websites that meet their needs, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics are achieved.</p>
